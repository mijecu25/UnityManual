Unity Manual
===========

During the summer of 2014, I performed an Individual Study of Game Development using Unity at the University of St. Thomas under the supervision of Patrick Jarvis. During this time, I independently learned Unity programming and wrote a manual for students. I became very familiar with Unity while developing several mini games and my first complete game: Urban Tennis.
